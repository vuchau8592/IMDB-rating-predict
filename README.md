# IMDB_rating_predict
Extension version of previous IMDB classification project. In this project, we will try to predict the IMDB score of movies with different regressors. Our expectation is that we can come up with a model that can achieve at least 70% accuracy when predicting.

In this project, the same dataset is used and it will be processed the same as the previous IMDB classification project.
